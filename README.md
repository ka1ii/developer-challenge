## Getting this repo up and running

This repo has three directories in it:

- `solidity`: Two example solidity contracts that can be compiled, tested, and deployed with Hardhat. [Go to the Readme](./solidity/)
- `backend`: A very simple TypeScript Node.js app that uses the FireFly SDK to interact with a custom smart contract. [Go to the Readme](./backen/)
- `frontend`: A TypeScript Next.js bootstrapped with tailwindcss that calls the API in the backend. [Go to the Readme](./frontend/)

You will need to first deploy the example smart contractsÂ with Hardhat to FireFly. Once the backend/frontend are started, the frontend will interact with the blockchain.
